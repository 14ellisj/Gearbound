    <h2>World Lore</h2>
    <img src="Images/Aethrion.png" alt="Cog City Visual" class="lore-img"/>
    <h3>The World of Aetherion</h3>
    <p>
        Aetherion is a world once ruled by kings, but now powered by cogs, coils, and clockwork. 
        It is an age of invention, where the boundaries between magic and machinery blur. 
        At its heart lies Cog City, the sprawling steampunk metropolis that ushered in the Gilded Era-a 
        time of great technological advancement, social progress, and unprecedented peace.
    </p>
    <h3>The Rise of Cog City</h3>
    <p>
        Hundreds of years ago, a group of visionary engineers known as the First Artificers built Cog City on 
        the back of an ancient, long-dormant Titan Engine—a living, mechanical mountain that once roamed the world. 
        They tamed it, converted its core into a city-wide power source, and constructed layer 
        upon layer of infrastructure, powered by steam, aether energy, and the mysterious Luminite Crystals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cog City became a beacon of civilization, a place where machines and sentient automatons lived alongside humans, 
        inventors, and explorers. It was governed by the Council of Gears, a ruling body of scientists and machine-sages 
        dedicated to progress and stability.
    </p>
    <h3>Disaster and Decay</h3>
    <p>
        But prosperity made the Council blind. In their ambition to build the Aether Spire, a massive tower meant to draw 
        energy from the skies themselves, they ignored warnings from the city’s central AI, OROS, guardian of the Great Gear Core.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Spire's activation backfired catastrophically—an aether surge caused massive system failures, blackout across entire 
        districts, and the awakening of Corruptbots, deranged automatons driven mad by aether exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Council vanished. The city fractured. Once self-sustaining, the Great Gear Core is now sputtering, and if it fails, 
        the entire city will shut down—and fall from the sky.
    </p>
    <h3>The Protagonists: The Gearbound</h3>
    <p>
        From the ashes rose a small group of self-aware, specialized automaton prototypes—The Gearbound—originally built as maintenance 
        bots for the city’s most dangerous jobs. When the Core glitched, their protocols were wiped, and something unexpected happened:
    </p>
    <p>
        They became sentient.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each Gearbound now possesses a fragment of OROS, giving them intelligence, personality, and free will. Guided by flickers of 
        memory and a shared mission, they band together to repair the Core, uncover the truth about the Spire, and decide the fate of Cog City.

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <img src="Images/FourCharacters.png" alt="Main Four Characters" class="four-img"/>
    <p>
        Born from broken systems and sparked into sentience, the Gearbound are more than maintenance bots. 
        Each was designed for a specific purpose in Cog City—but now, they’ve evolved into heroes. With unique abilities, 
        distinct personalities, and pieces of OROS embedded in their cores, these four are the city’s final hope.
    </p>
    <div class="four-columns">
    <div class="column">
        <h2>Springa - The Acrobat</h2>
        <p>Role: Vertical movement and spring-based traversal</p>
        <p>Specialties: Double jumps, bounce chains, access to high places</p>
        <p>
            Backstory: Springa was designed to maintain Cog City’s vertical gardens and high-altitude structures. 
            Her elastic limbs and reinforced coil-legs make her the queen of movement. After gaining self-awareness, 
            she embraced exploration with unrelenting joy. Her systems thrive on momentum—both in motion and mood.
        </p>
        <p>Personality: Cheerful, impulsive, sometimes reckless. Speaks in bursts of excitement and unexpected wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <h2>Bolt - The Scout</h2>
      <p>Role: Fast mover, all-rounder, team leader.</p>
      <p>Specialties: Dash burst, steam-vent jumps, piston punches</p>
      <p>
        Backstory: Originally built to inspect high-pressure vents and emergency 
        routes, Bolt became the first Gearbound to achieve sentience. Agile, reliable, 
        and determined, Bolt often leads the group—more out of instinct than pride. 
        His internal sensors flicker with forgotten blueprints and half-erased schematics, 
        driving him to uncover the truth behind the city’s fall.
    </p>
    <p>Personality: Balanced, curious, sarcastic under pressure. Acts as the emotional anchor for the team.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Watt - The Conduit</h2>
      <p>Role: Power-based support and environmental activation</p>
      <p>Specialties: Electrical bursts, machine reactivation, overcharge puzzles</p>
      <p>Backstory: Watt was created to maintain and balance Cog City’s power grid. When the surge occurred, he absorbed more than just 
        electricity—he took in raw aetheric data, giving him not just strength, but insight. Watt is deliberate in his movements and words, 
        always considering the greater outcome of every action.
      </p>
      <p>Personality: Stoic, philosophical, loyal. Believes deeply in restoring balance—not just to the city, but to the Gearbound themselves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <h2>Hex - The Hacker</h2>
      <p>Role: Terminal access, stealth, intelligence gathering</p>
      <p>Specialties: Hacking panels, brief invisibility, remote gadget control</p>
      <p>
        Backstory: Hex was part of Cog City’s internal defense system—a security subroutine given physical form. 
        As OROS fractured, her purpose fragmented, leaving behind traces of code from both the Council and the rogue 
        AI network. She now walks the line between watcher and warrior, wielding data as deftly as others wield tools.
      </p>
      <p>Personality: Sharp, dry, observant. Knows more than she lets on—especially about OROS and the Aether Spire.</p>

    <h2>The Realms of Cog City</h2>
    <img src="Images/Map3.png" alt="Map" class="four-img"/>
    <p>Cog City is divided into five sprawling districts, each with its own atmosphere, hazards, and secrets. From the molten depths of Brass Borough to the sky-scraping mystery of the Aether Spire, every realm offers unique challenges and lore.</p>

  <h3>Brass Borough – The Industrial Heart</h3>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Steam vents, molten metal, broken machines</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Once the city's main manufacturing hub, Brass Borough is now rusted and unstable. Conveyor belts grind against jammed cogs, and the air is thick with soot and pressure. It’s where your journey begins—hot, heavy, and full of secrets.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Furnace puzzles, gear elevators, steam-platforming</p>

  <h3>Gleam Gardens – Nature Reclaimed</h3>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Overgrown greenhouses, hybrid flora, collapsing eco-labs</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> A district once meant to feed the city has become a wild and living labyrinth. Vines strangle machinery, and plants mutated by aether energy lash out. Water puzzles and high-flying bounce mechanics rule here.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Spring-based traversal, root mazes, bio-mechanical bosses</p>

  <h3>Sprocket Square – Clockwork Capital</h3>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Ticking gears, time puzzles, market ruins</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> This was the beating heart of daily life—shops, lifts, and time-regulated platforms. Now it's stuck in a broken rhythm. Expect vertical puzzles, platform syncs, and a very aggressive gear-based sentinel.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Rotating floors, market minigames, time-based switches</p>

  <h3>Volt Vaults – The Forgotten Grid</h3>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Power outages, corrupted terminals, dark corridors</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Deep beneath Cog City lie the power vaults—once brilliant, now pitch-black. Surging conduits, glitching bots, and electric puzzles await those brave enough to descend. Bring a light... or be one.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Circuit logic puzzles, blackout areas, terminal hacking</p>

  <h3>The Aether Spire – Skyward Legacy</h3>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Floating platforms, anti-gravity, corrupted energy</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Spire was the city’s greatest ambition—and its final mistake. The structure now floats in broken silence, warped by raw aether. Gravity shifts, mirrors lie, and your final choices await.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Aether storm hazards, puzzle illusions, moral final choice</p>

  <p>Each district in Cog City is a story in itself, a puzzle box to unravel. As the Gearbound, you'll explore every gear, shadow, and secret Cog City has to offer.</p>
